# Searching_Algorithm
Algorithms to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
## Linear Search
* It is a sequential search algorithm i.e. the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.
* It is rarely used practically.

| Case | Complexity |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Worst Case` | **O(n)** |
| `Average Case` | **O(n)** |
| `Best Case`  |  **O(1)**|
| `Auxiliary Space` | **O(1)**|

## Binary Search
* It is an interval search algorithm.
* This algorithms is specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. 
* This type of searching algorithm is much more efficient than Linear Search.
* It employs recursive approach which requires more stack space.
* The interaction of binary search with memory hierarchy i.e. caching is poor.

| Case | Complexity |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Worst Case` | **O(log n)** |
| `Average Case` | **O(log n)** |
| `Best Case`  |  **O(1)**|
| `Auxiliary Space (iterative) `| **O(1)**|
| ` Auxiliary Space (recursive)`|**O(log n)**|
